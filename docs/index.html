    <p>If you have more than one camera on your PC you may need to adjust which camera should be used. This can be set on
        the command line with the option --camera-index:</p>
    <pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> PATH_TO_REPO
    detectqr --camera-<span class="hljs-built_in">index</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p><em>Note: Make sure to replace PATH_TO_REPO with the path to this repository</em> </p>
